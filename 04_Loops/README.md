# 04 🔁 Loops
Loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.  
They help reduce code repetition and make programs efficient.

## 📌 Types of Loops in Java

Java provides the following types of loops:
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. enhanced for loop (for-each)

---

## 1. For Loop 🔁

The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

---

## 2. While Loop ⏳

The while loop checks the condition first and executes the loop as long as the condition is true.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

---

## 3. Do-While Loop 🔄

The do-while loop executes the code at least once, even if the condition is false.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
do {
    // code to be executed
}
```

---

## 4. Enhanced For Loop (For-Each) 📦

The enhanced for loop is used to iterate through arrays and collections.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
for (dataType variable : array) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
