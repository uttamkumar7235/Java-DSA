# 04 Loops 🔁
Loops in Java are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.  
They help reduce code repetition and make programs efficient.

## 📌 Types of Loops in Java

Java supports the following loops:
1. 🔢 `for` loop  
2. ⏳ `while` loop  
3. 🔄 `do-while` loop  
4. 📦 enhanced `for-each` loop

---

## 1️⃣ For Loop 🔁

The `for` loop is used when the **number of iterations is known**.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

---

## 2️⃣ While Loop ⏳

The while loop checks the condition first and executes the loop **as long as the condition is true**.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

---

## 3️⃣ Do-While Loop 🔄

The do-while loop executes the code **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
do {
    // code to be executed
}
```

---

## 4️⃣ Enhanced For Loop (For-Each) 📦

The enhanced for loop is used to iterate through **arrays and collections**.

### 🧩 Syntax
```java
for (dataType variable : array) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
